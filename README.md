## Features

- The model generator library is the main engine that supports the CLI tool. Use it directly or from the CLI tool.  Using the Microsoft.OpenApi library, this package reads OpenAPI documents, processes them, and outputs well-structured C# classes ready for use in your project.
- See CLI Tool README for information on how to use the CLI tool. Use the CLI tool to stream line generating C# classes with ease in seconds.
